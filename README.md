# 📦 Custom Post Manager – WordPress Plugin (By Shalini Gupta)

This is a beginner-friendly WordPress plugin project aimed at helping users create and manage custom post types (CPTs) on their websites. It's part of my learning journey as I explore PHP, WordPress development, and open-source collaboration.

---

## 🎯 Goal

The goal of this plugin is to provide a simple way for users to:
- Register new custom post types (e.g., Projects, Events)
- Display those posts on any page using a shortcode
- Add useful features like meta fields, filters, and styling (in future updates)

## 🛠️ Current Status

🚧 **Work in Progress**  
Code will be added as I learn and implement each feature step by step.
